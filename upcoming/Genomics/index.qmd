:::

Genomics teaches data management and analysis for genomics research including:

- best practices for organization of bioinformatics projects and data, 
- use of command-line utilities to connect to and use cloud computing and storage resources, 
- use of command-line tools for data preparation, 
- use of command-line tools to analyze sequence quality and perform and automate variant calling.

The next online Genomics workshop will take place from 15-24 January 2024.

## Target audience 
- Learners who have completed the Prenomics Course 
- PhD Students & Researchers
- This course would be appropriate for learners with experience using the command line, who are expecting to generate a dataset in the future or those who already have a dataset and would like guidance on how to analyse it. 

## Registration
There are 30 places available for this online workshop, please register using the [online form](https://forms.gle/Jwf4Hg1Kk6UKwbRo9). This course is free of charge. 

## Pre-requisites 
Knowledge: learners should have completed the Prenomics course or be able to successfully complete the [self-assessment quiz](https://shiny.york.ac.uk/er13/prenomics-quiz/). 
Learners are also expected to have some familiarity with biological concepts, including the concept of genomic variation within a population. 
Software: view the required [software set-up](https://cloud-span.github.io/00genomics/setup).

| Monday 23 January 2024 | 10:00 - 13:00 | Session 3 - Assessing read quality; trimming and filtering reads.|
|                       |               | • Trimming and filtering <br> • Learn how to filter out poor quality data <br> • Assessing read quality |
| Wednesday 24 January 2024 | 11:00 - 14:00 | Session 4 - Finding sequence variants                         |
|                       |               | • Understand the steps involved in variant calling <br> • Describe the types of data formats encountered during variant calling <br> • Use command line tools to perform variant calling <br> • Instructors will give a demonstration on how to use the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV), an interactive tool for the visual exploration of genomic data. |

## Learning outcomes 
Following completion of this course, learners will be able to

- structure their data and metadata and plan for an NGS project
- organise and document genomics data and bioinformatics workflows
- understand what information is needed by a sequencing facility 
- gain practice navigating file systems, creating, copying, moving, and removing files and directories
- use command-line tools to assess read quality and perform quality control
- align reads to a reference genome, and identify and visualise sequence variants
- work with Amazon AWS cloud computing and transfer data between a local computer and cloud resources

## Scholarships 
We offer scholarships to enable members of underrepresented groups and those with financial difficulties to participate in our training courses. 

The scholarship scheme can cover approximately £150 per application, for costs such as:

- childcare
- accessibility needs
- other costs that might otherwise prevent participation
