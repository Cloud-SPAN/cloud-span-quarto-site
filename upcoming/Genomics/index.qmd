description: Learn data management and analytical skills for genomic research
---

Genomics teaches data management and analysis for genomics research including:
(1) best practices for organization of bioinformatics projects and data, 
(2) use of command-line utilities to connect to and use cloud computing and storage resources, 
(3) use of command-line tools for data preparation, 
(4) use of command-line tools to analyze sequence quality and perform and automate variant calling.

## Target audience 
- Learners who have completed the Prenomics Course 
- PhD Students & Researchers
- This course would be appropriate for learners with experience using the command line, who are expecting to generate a dataset in the future or those who already have a dataset and would like guidance on how to analyse it. 

## Registration
There are 30 places available for this online workshop, please register using the online form. This course is free of charge. 

## Pre-requisites 
Knowledge: learners should have completed the Prenomics course or be able to successfully complete the self-assessment quiz. Learners are also expected to have some familiarity with biological concepts, including the concept of genomic variation within a population. Please note, you will need to complete the Creating your own instance course beforehand.
Software: view the required software set-up.

## Learning outcomes 
Following completion of this course, learners will be able to

- structure their data and metadata and plan for an NGS project
- organise and document genomics data and bioinformatics workflows
- understand what information is needed by a sequencing facility 
- gain practice navigating file systems, creating, copying, moving, and removing files and directories
- use command-line tools to assess read quality and perform quality control
- align reads to a reference genome, and identify and visualise sequence variants
- work with Amazon AWS cloud computing and transfer data between a local computer and cloud resources
