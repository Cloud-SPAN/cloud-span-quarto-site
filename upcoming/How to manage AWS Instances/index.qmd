## Introduction

## Target audience 
The target audience of the course is anyone in charge of, or interested in, deploying and managing cloud resources. While the module is focused on AWS, and particularly Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, the scripts can be adapted for use with other cloud providers and other types of cloud services.

## Pre-requisites 
The workshop assumes no prior experience with the AWS concepts and tools covered but you will need experience of the Linux Terminal (Shell/Command Line Interface).

## Programme 

The workshop teaches the method we have used for over 2 years to efficiently manage AWS instances for our workshops using a set of Bash scripts. Creating over 30 instances takes 10-15 minutes. The workshop is aimed at those who need or plan to manage similar cloud resources for training such as Research Software Engineers or Bioinformatics Units Support Staff.

## Learning outcomes 
Following completion of this course, learners will be able to

- configure and run the scripts to create and manage instances for workshops, manage late registrations and cancellations, and troubleshooting
- create, manage and configure AMI templates (from which instances are created) with their own data and software analysis tools
- understand how the scripts work so they can customise them.
