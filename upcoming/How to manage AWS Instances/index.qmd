## Introduction

## Target audience 
The target audience of the course is anyone in charge of, or interested in, deploying and managing cloud resources. While the module is focused on AWS, and particularly Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, the scripts can be adapted for use with other cloud providers and other types of cloud services.

## Pre-requisites 
The workshop assumes no prior experience with the AWS concepts and tools covered but you will need experience of the Linux Terminal (Shell/Command Line Interface).

## Programme 

Topic 1 Setting up the work environment - Learn how to set up your working environment, your AWS account and your shell terminal configuration, to be able to run the scripts. 
Topic 2 Managing AWS instances - Learn some best practices to deploy and manage AWS instances for a course, for testing software configurations, for creating new AMIs. 
Topic 3 Managing AMIs, Scripts - Learn the blurry bits of the scripts, how to control changes to the scripts with GitHub, the Cloud-SPAN AMIs, when and how to create and control AMI versions, updating an AMI Linux and software tools, and more. 

## Learning outcomes 
Following completion of this course, learners will be able to

- configure and run the scripts to create and manage instances for workshops, manage late registrations and cancellations, and troubleshooting
- create, manage and configure AMI templates (from which instances are created) with their own data and software analysis tools
- understand how the scripts work so they can customise them.
