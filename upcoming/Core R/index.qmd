# Target Audience

This workshop is an introduction to R for complete beginners. 

Check out testimonials from previous attendees!

> !I had some background knowledge in R, but needed to refresh my memory for my PhD data analysis. I expected a dull and slow course, but instead was pleasantly surprised when the course was easy to follow, snappy and very informative! I left the workshop feeling confident using R going forward - I definitely recommend this course for anyone who needs to use R!"


> "This course was a very good introduction to the basic workings of R and RStudio. After completing this course I now feel comfortable with basic scripting, reading/summarising data and creating/exporting plots. Two hours very well spent!"

> "I would definitely recommend this course to any beginner in R. An insightful and comprehensive foundation to coding."

> "This course was fantastic in both helping me to understand the concepts behind metagenomic polishing/assembly processes and in actually learning how to do it ourselves. I have learnt a lot that I can confidently go and apply to my own research."
