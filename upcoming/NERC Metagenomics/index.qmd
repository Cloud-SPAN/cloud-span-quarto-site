## Register for Metagenomics

:::

Metagenomics explores all the genetic material in an environmental sample. It can be used to characterise the taxonomic characteristics of microbial communities.

This online module will be delivered over a three-week period from Monday 6th to Friday 24th November 2023.

Metagenomics analyses involve a lot of data and can take hours to days to complete! But don't worry! The format of the workshop takes account of this. For longer analyses there will be scheduled online zoom sessions to cover concepts and get started followed by offline time for the analysis run and for you to complete some exercises. These will be supported by online drop-ins and a Slack channel for trouble-shooting.

# Target audience

UK based Environmental Science researchers at any career stage or anyone with an interest in Metagenomics. We assume no prior experience of the command line or high performance computing. Due to our funding, we prioritise places to researchers within the NERC remit.

Check out testimonials from previous attendees!

> "This course was fantastic in both helping me to understand the concepts behind metagenomic polishing/assembly processes and in actually learning how to do it ourselves. I have learnt a lot that I can confidently go and apply to my own research."

> "Really recommend this course! The content was great, covering command line fundamentals and the whole metagenomics workflow in a way that was really easy to understand. The team were super engaged and helpful throughout!"

> "Really pleased with how the course was ran. The instructors were clear and patient, and the online course materials were thorough. I really enjoyed the taxonomic analysis as it brought everything we learned together. This course is super applicable for when I collect and analyse my data further into my PhD project. :)"

:::

There are 30 places available for this online workshop, please register using [**the online form**](https://forms.gle/eJ3xWAb3Cy6wZVyk8). Priority will be given to NERC funded students and researchers, as well as researchers from underrepresented groups, although we encourage everyone to apply. This course is free of charge.

Application deadline: 12pm Wednesday 18th October. Applicants will be notified by Monday 23rd October if they have been allocated a place. Scholarships and funding for headsets and monitors will be available.

# Programme

We start by teaching the essential tools used in High Performance computing such as file systems and the command-line to connect to and use cloud computing for file navigation and script writing. We then introduce metagenomics and building a metagenomic assembly. In the second week, you will learn how to improve your assembly by 'polishing', separate your assembled metagenome into individual genomes (MAGS) and conduct taxonomic assignment and analysis. But if you can't get something to work, we have a Slack channel and a weekly drop-in to help.

**Win £25 in Amazon vouchers for showing commitment to your learning!**

At Cloud-SPAN we know it's difficult to find time to train so we've come up with a little incentive for learners signed up for the online course. For the Metagenomics course there will be a prize draw and two people will win a £25 Amazon voucher! All you have to do to enter the prize draw is go through the exercises - we will use your command history to verify your efforts. It doesn't matter if you make mistakes or can't get something to work, it is your commitment that matters!

*Happy learning!*

If you are unable to attend an online session, recordings will be distributed. You will have access to your instance until Friday 1 December (one week after the course is completed) to give you time to consolidate your learning. Usage of the instances will be monitored; instances which are inactive will be closed down as a daily charge is incurred.

We recommend workshop participants have a second monitor and a headset. Dual monitors allow you to engage with the trainers, view materials shared on screen and other participants on one monitor while doing the activities on another. To support you with your learning we have funding to provide you with a headset and a monitor if you require this. To request this additional funding please indicate this in the registration form. Funds for the monitors and headsets will be distributed at the end of course to those participants who regularly attended the online sessions.

# Pre-requisites

You will need familiarity with biological concepts, including the concept of microbiome. We assume no prior experience of the command line or high performance computing. Windows users will need to install GitBash.

You don't need to worry about installing metagenomics software or putting the data on your own computer! You will have access to an Amazon Web Services instance with all the data and software and will only need to log in to it.

# Learning outcomes

Following completion of this course, learners will be able to:

-   explain the hierarchical structure of a file system and describe the files and file structure used in the course
-   explain what is meant by a working directory, a path and a relative path and write down paths that they will need for the course
-   start a Terminal (Mac) or Git Bash Terminal (Windows)
-   navigate a file system using the command line
-   log in to and exit their AWS instance (the cloud)
-   use common commands such as ls, pwd and cd, on the command line
-   know the difference between genomics and metagenomics
-   describe the steps in a metagenomic workflow
-   perform quality control on reads and assemble them into a metagenome
-   perform polishing to improve an assembly
-   use binning to separate the metagenome into different species or MAGs (Metagenome-Assembled Genomes)
-   use Kraken 2 to assign taxonomy to reads and contigs and phyloseq in R to analyse taxonomic diversity
