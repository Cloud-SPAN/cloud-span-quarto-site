#### About

Cloud-SPAN trains researchers, and the research software engineers that support them, to run specialised analyses on cloud-based high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure.

Cloud-SPAN hosts live training workshops and has also created educational training materials on topics such as using the command line, genomic analysis and whole metagenome sequencing (WMS) workflows. All of the  training materials and live workshops are offered **free of charge**.


# Our approach 

- **Inclusive** to anyone interested in big data, we remove barriers that may have prevented learners from participating before. Only a laptop and an internet connection is required to access the materials and participate in workshops.
- Learning materials are designed to be as **accessible** as possible to beginners, with lots of guidance and reassurance along the way.
- During the live workshops learners participate in **live- coding**, learning by doing and providing practical hands-on experience with tutor support
- Participants in taught workshops receive **free access** to an AWS instance containing all the software and data you'll need for the duration of the teaching period. 
- The learning environment at live workshops is **very welcoming**, encouraging and inclusive. A lot of our learners are complete beginners or new to this world of big data, command line and cloud computing. 
- **Scholarships** are available to enable members of underrepresented groups and those with financial difficulties to participate in our training courses.

# Our learning resources

**Core skills** - Core R and Prenomics were created to introduce the fundamentals of the command line and to help learners gain confidence in their programming skills. 

**Specialised skills** - Learners who were already confident with their command line abilities were encouraged to complete Genomics and Metagenomics. An online assessment was developed for learners to self assess their level of knowledge and help them to gauge which course would be most appropriate for them. The workshop on Statistically Useful Experimental Design was developed to help researchers to understand the issues underpinning good experimental design, to ensure that reproducible techniques are used to produce data.

::: callout-note
The only course which requires significant prior experience in programming is [Automated Management of AWS Instances](#cloud-admin) which is aimed at computing professionals and research software engineers.

Community 
We have established a welcoming online community to support learners, including self-paced learners, in the application of training materials to their own research data.
