Cloud-SPAN trains researchers, and the research software engineers that support them, to run specialised analyses on cloud-based high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure. Cloud-SPAN is developing highly accessible resources which integrate with existing Carpentries courses.

We offer Diversity Scholarships to cover travel and/or childcare to enable members of underrepresented groups to participate in online or in-person training.
