Cloud-SPAN trains researchers, and the research software engineers that support them, to run specialised analyses on cloud-based high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure. Cloud-SPAN has developed accessible learning resources to develop the big data analytics skills of UK based early-career researchers.

Scholarships are available to enable members of underrepresented groups and those with financial difficulties to participate in our training courses.

Cloud-SPAN was initially established in March 2021 as a 2-year collaboration between the University of York and The Software Sustainability Institute, funded by the UKRI Innovation Scholars award (project reference: MR/V038680/1). Additional funding from the Natural Environment Research Council (project references: NE/X006999/1 and NE/Y003527/1) allows the project to be extended until August 2024.
