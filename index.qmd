Cloud-SPAN was established in March 2021 initially as a 2-year collaboration between the University of York and The Software Sustainability Institute funded by the UKRI innovation scholars award, project reference: MR/V038680/1.  Additional funding from the Natural Environment Research Council, project references: NE/X006999/1 and NE/Y003527/1 allows the project to be extended until January 2024.
