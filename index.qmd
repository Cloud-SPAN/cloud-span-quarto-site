Cloud-SPAN trains researchers, and the research software engineers that support them, to run specialised analyses on cloud-based high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure. 

A collection of open access online resources for learning and teaching 'omics with Cloud-based High Performance Computing has been created. The 8 modules hosted via GitHub are aimed at both bioscience researchers and the research computing teams that support them. The FAIR principles were applied during the preparation of all the training resources to ensure that they can be reused and remixed by others for their own teaching purposes 

Scholarships are available to enable members of underrepresented groups and those with financial difficulties to participate in our training courses.

Cloud-SPAN was initially established in March 2021 as a 2-year collaboration between the University of York and The Software Sustainability Institute, funded by the UKRI Innovation Scholars award (project reference: MR/V038680/1). Additional funding from the Natural Environment Research Council (project references: NE/X006999/1 and NE/Y003527/1) allows the project to be extended until August 2024.
