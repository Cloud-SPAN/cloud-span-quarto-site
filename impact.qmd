# Our Impact: Cloud-SPAN February 2021 - June 2024

Since the launch of the Cloud-SPAN project in February 2021, the team has worked hard to develop and deliver accessible training resources that enable interdisciplinary researchers to generate and analyse big data using cloud-
based high performance computing.

This impact report is based on data collected from our course participants to better understand how the training resources impacted them, both immediately after they attended training events and in the longer term. 
From February 2021 to June 2024 we have provided 31 training activities to over 350 participants based at 76 institutions across the UK. We are proud of the inclusive and welcoming learning environment we provide, which sees 28% of our learners return to take a second course. Networks have been established nationwide, facilitating an exchange of knowledge and experience. Our open-access self-study materials are hosted on GitHub and accessible to everyone, allowing participants the convenience of learning at their own pace. 32 scholarships have been allocated to members of underrepresented groups in science and those with financial difficulties.
