**Join the University of York's Bioinformatics Meeting on â€˜Career pathways into bioinformaticsâ€™.**

Hosted by Sarah Forrester, we have a jam packed hour and a half.

Evelyn Greeves from the Cloud-SPAN team will be leading a short session on "Introduction to FAIR and metadata" with an opportunity for you to ask any questions that you may have.Â Â 

Following this, have you pondered what direction to take your career or how to use your data skills in future projects? We have 3 speakers who explain how data analysis has been incorporated into their work.Â 

ðŸ”¸ Emma Rand highlights the different paths into academia and using big data skills.Â 

ðŸ”¸ James Chong explains how learning bioinformatics was the only way to get past the bottleneck of being able to analyse data he was generating.

ðŸ”¸ Sarah Forrester explores how bioinformatics opens doors to moving between different research niches.Â 

We will then have a discussion with all speakers for the remainder of the session, which will include signposting resources.Â 

Session slides will be available following the event.Â 

Event details: Wednesday, 6th July, 15:00-16:30 in room B/T/019 University of York.Â
