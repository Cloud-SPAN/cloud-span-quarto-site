Bioinformatics Meeting on ‘Career pathways into bioinformatics’
22/06/22		Sarah Dowsland

Join the University of York's Bioinformatics Meeting on ‘Career pathways into bioinformatics’.

Hosted by Sarah Forrester, we have a jam packed hour and a half.

Evelyn Greeves from the Cloud-SPAN team will be leading a short session on "Introduction to FAIR and metadata" with an opportunity for you to ask any questions that you may have.  

Following this, have you pondered what direction to take your career or how to use your data skills in future projects? We have 3 speakers who explain how data analysis has been incorporated into their work. 

🔸 Emma Rand highlights the different paths into academia and using big data skills. 

🔸 James Chong explains how learning bioinformatics was the only way to get past the bottleneck of being able to analyse data he was generating.

🔸 Sarah Forrester explores how bioinformatics opens doors to moving between different research niches. 

We will then have a discussion with all speakers for the remainder of the session, which will include signposting resources. 

Session slides will be available following the event. 

Event details: Wednesday, 6th July, 15:00-16:30 in room B/T/019 University of York.
