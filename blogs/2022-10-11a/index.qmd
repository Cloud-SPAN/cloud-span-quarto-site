Just to let you know regarding an event happening on **Wednesday 19th October** which might be of interest: the UK Reproducibility Network are running an online [workshop on FAIR data in the life sciences](https://www.ukrn.org/event/fair-data-life-sciences-oct-2022/) which should be really informative and useful. You'll learn about what FAIR data is, why it's important and where you can go for further training on this issue. Plus, our very own Cloud-SPAN's Evelyn Greeves will be talking about Cloud-SPAN and how we've made our courses FAIR!
