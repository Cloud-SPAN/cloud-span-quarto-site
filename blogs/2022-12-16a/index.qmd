We have scholarships to cover expenses to attend the Northern Bioinformatics User Group (Northern BUG) meeting to be held on Friday 13th January 2023 at the University of Huddersfield.

NorthernBUG is a network of bioinformaticians and users or bioinformatics services in the north of England which hold quarterly meetings to build a community of researchers and others using big data in biology. NorthernBUG meetings are open to anyone interested in bioinformatics or its application in life science research and beyond. Meetings are free and early career researchers are especially encouraged career to attend and present their work. Itâ€™s a great forum to practice your talks, float new ideas and approaches, and present early work.

We have scholarships to cover travel expenses for five of our Cloud-SPAN 'graduates' to attend NBUG. Register for NBUG and complete a scholarship application with us here by Thursday 5th January 2023.
