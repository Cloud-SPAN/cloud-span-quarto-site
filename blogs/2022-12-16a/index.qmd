We have **scholarships** to cover expenses to attend the [Northern Bioinformatics User Group (Northern BUG)](https://northernbug.github.io/) meeting to be held on Friday 13th January 2023 at the University of Huddersfield.

NorthernBUG is a network of bioinformaticians and users or bioinformatics services in the north of England which hold quarterly meetings to build a community of researchers and others using big data in biology. NorthernBUG meetings are open to **anyone** interested in bioinformatics or its application in life science research and beyond. **Meetings are free** and early career researchers are especially encouraged career to attend and present their work.
