Professor James Chong selected as an Oracle Research Fellow
Cloud-SPAN PI, Prof James Chong has recently been selected (as one of three globally) Oracle for Research Fellows for their Spring 2023 cohort.  This industrially-funded fellowship includes a cash award of $100,000 (£81,000) and £132,200 of Oracle Cloud compute credits for a project entitled Using shotgun metagenomics data to develop a synthetic anaerobic digestion (AD) community. 

Although James officially holds the award, the successful application was a team effort driven by Dr Sarah Forrester and Annabel Cansdale, both part of the Centre of Excellence for Anaerobic Digestion (CEAD) and Cloud-SPAN Instructors, who were heavily involved in preparing the application, and who will make use of the Cloud compute award throughout this project.
