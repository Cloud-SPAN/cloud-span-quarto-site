# Register for Prenomics 6-7 December 2023 using the [online form](https://forms.gle/MnuYycBuBfkpX7R18)

:::

In Prenomics, all the focus is on the command line. We teach about files and directory structure, and spend lots of time guiding learners through creating a folder and navigating to it without using the command line. We also teach those crucial core skills - commonly used commands like `ls`, `cd` and `mv`. Later, as learners gain confidence, we move on to more complex commands like grep and redirection with `>` and `>>`.

# Register for Genomics 15-25 January 2023 using the [online form](https://forms.gle/Jwf4Hg1Kk6UKwbRo9)

:::

Genomics is taught over 4 sessions and teaches best practice for organization of bioinformatics projects and data. You will log onto a cloud instance and start navigating using the command line. During the sessions you will be taught how to assess read quality as well as trimming and filtering reads. In the final session you explore how to how to align reads to a reference genome, identify and visualise between-sample variation.
