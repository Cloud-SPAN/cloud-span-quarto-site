We are excited to announce that our next Code Retreat will take place at 10:30-15:00 on 31st May 2023 at the University of York. It provides a chance for course alumni to come together and work on their own data problems with the support of Cloud-SPAN instructors. 

**What happens at a Code Retreat?**

At previous retreats some people took the opportunity to revisit course materials and ask questions about the topics they didn't understand. There are plenty of helpers on hand to answer questions and test understanding.

You could also apply the workflows and analyses taught in the Genomics course to your own datasets. Helpers are also on hand to discuss topics such as:

-   how to organise bioinformatics projects;

-   which tools are most effective;

-   how to approach a problem;

-   what analysis is best for a certain type of data;

as well as many others. 

Some participants already know what help they will need and have specific questions to address during the day. Those with a less clear understanding of their problem could benefit from talking through their data and getting guidance from our experienced instructors. You could even try out new software tools.

**What do previous participants have to say?**

"I had a great time at the Cloud-Span retreat. I went from Lancaster just for it, and it was worth it. I got support in analysing the data I had in hand. That was really satisfying applying what we preciously learned (using our data this time). Having the Cloud-Span Team around to support us was essential. It's been great learning with them, and I would 100% recommend them!"
