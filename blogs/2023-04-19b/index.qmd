NorthernBUG is a really useful and free meeting where lots of people working on bioinformatics get a chance to get together. More importantly, because the meeting is free, registration early is essential so that the appropriate level of catering can be ordered. So if you're interested in going, please register by the **31st of May**. If you would like to give a poster/talk the deadline for this is the **30th of April.** There will be prizes for posters so it is well worth submitting for a poster. NorthernBUG is a great event to go to whether you are completely new to bioinformatics or a seasoned bioinformatician.
