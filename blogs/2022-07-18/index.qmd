### **Hello Cloud-SPAN community!**

We have **scholarships** to cover expenses to attend the [Northern Bioinformatics User Group (Northern BUG)](https://northernbug.github.io/) meeting to be held on September 9th 2022 at the University of Bradford.

NorthernBUG is a network of bioinformaticians and users or bioinformatics services in the north of England which hold quarterly meetings to build a community of researchers and others using big data in biology. NorthernBUG meetings are open to **anyone** interested in bioinformatics or its application in life science research and beyond. **Meetings are free** and early career researchers are especially encouraged career to attend and present their work. Itâ€™s a great forum to practice your talks, float new ideas and approaches, and present early work.

One of my project students, Chloe Brook, presented her work there:

She is now at the [Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre](https://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/about-us/our-team/chloe-brook).
