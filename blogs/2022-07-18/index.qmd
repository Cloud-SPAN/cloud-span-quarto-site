Hello Cloud-SPAN community!
We have scholarships to cover expenses to attend the Northern Bioinformatics User Group (Northern BUG) meeting to be held on September 9th 2022 at the University of Bradford.

NorthernBUG is a network of bioinformaticians and users or bioinformatics services in the north of England which hold quarterly meetings to build a community of researchers and others using big data in biology. NorthernBUG meetings are open to anyone interested in bioinformatics or its application in life science research and beyond. Meetings are free and early career researchers are especially encouraged career to attend and present their work. Itâ€™s a great forum to practice your talks, float new ideas and approaches, and present early work.

One of my project students, Chloe Brook, presented her work there:


She is now at the Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre.

We have scholarships to cover travel expenses for five of our Cloud-SPAN 'graduates' to attend NBUG. Register for NBUG here and complete a scholarship application with us here by Monday 22nd August.
