It can be used to characterise the taxonomic characteristics of microbial communities.\nThis online module will be delivered over a three-week period from Monday 6th to Friday 24th November 2023.\nMetagenomics analyses involve a lot of data and can take hours to days to complete! But don’t worry! The format of the workshop takes account of this. For longer analyses there will be scheduled online zoom sessions to cover concepts and get started followed by offline time for the analysis run and for you to complete some exercises. These will be supported by online drop-ins and a Slack channel for trouble-shooting.\n\nTarget audience\nUK based Environmental Science researchers at any career stage or anyone with an interest in Metagenomics. We assume no prior experience of the command line or high performance computing. Due to our funding, we prioritise places to researchers within the NERC remit.\nCheck out testimonials from previous attendees!\n\n“This course was fantastic in both helping me to understand the concepts behind metagenomic polishing/assembly processes and in actually learning how to do it ourselves. I have learnt a lot that I can confidently go and apply to my own research.”\n\n\n“Really recommend this course! The content was great, covering command line fundamentals and the whole metagenomics workflow in a way that was really easy to understand. The team were super engaged and helpful throughout!”\n\n\n“Really pleased with how the course was ran. The instructors were clear and patient, and the online course materials were thorough. I really enjoyed the taxonomic analysis as it brought everything we learned together. This course is super applicable for when I collect and analyse my data further into my PhD project. :)”\n\n\n\nRegistration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegister for Metagenomics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are 30 places available for this online workshop, please register using the online form. Priority will be given to NERC funded students and researchers, as well as researchers from underrepresented groups, although we encourage everyone to apply. This course is free of charge.\nApplication deadline: 12pm Wednesday 18th October. Applicants will be notified by Monday 23rd October if they have been allocated a place. Scholarships and funding for headsets and monitors will be available.\n\n\nProgramme\nWe start by teaching the essential tools used in High Performance computing such as file systems and the command-line to connect to and use cloud computing for file navigation and script writing. We then introduce metagenomics and building a metagenomic assembly. In the second week, you will learn how to improve your assembly by ‘polishing’, separate your assembled metagenome into individual genomes (MAGS) and conduct taxonomic assignment and analysis. But if you can’t get something to work, we have a Slack channel and a weekly drop-in to help.\nWin £25 in Amazon vouchers for showing commitment to your learning!\nAt Cloud-SPAN we know it’s difficult to find time to train so we’ve come up with a little incentive for learners signed up for the online course. For the Metagenomics course there will be a prize draw and two people will win a £25 Amazon voucher! All you have to do to enter the prize draw is go through the exercises - we will use your command history to verify your efforts. It doesn’t matter if you make mistakes or can’t get something to work, it is your commitment that matters!\nHappy learning!\nWeek 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonday 6 November\n14:00 - 16:00\nCommand-line programming: file systems, files and directories\n\n\nTuesday 7 November\n14:00 - 16:00\nCommand-line programming: using the command line\n\n\nThursday 9 November\n10:00 - 13:30\nAn introduction to metagenomics, quality control and assembly.\n\n\n\n\nOffline time for assembly to complete.\n\n\n\nWeek 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonday 13 November\n14:00 - 15:00\nOnline troubleshooting drop-in session (optional)\n\n\nWednesday 15 November\n10:00 - 11:30\nPolishing your metagenome assembly.\n\n\n\n\nOffline time for the polishing to complete\n\n\nFriday 17 November\n14:00 - 15:00\nOnline troubleshooting drop-in session (optional)\n\n\n\nWeek 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTuesday 21 November\n10:00 - 11:30\nBinning a metagenome assembly into individual genomes (MAGS)\n\n\n\n\nOffline time for the binning to complete\n\n\nTuesday 21 November\n10:00 - 11:00\nOnline troubleshooting drop-in session (optional)\n\n\nFriday 24 November\n13:00 - 16:00\nTaxonomic Assignment and Analysis\n\n\n\nIf you are unable to attend an online session, recordings will be distributed.

    "title": "What is FAIR data?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "At Cloud-SPAN we care deeply about making science as open as possible. A lot of this comes down to project management and data organisation - which we teach as part of our Genomics course. Today we want to introduce you to the FAIR data principles, which are a framework for thinking about how to ensure the scientific community gets the most out of the data we produce. In this case, this means making it easier for people to find and reuse our hard-earned data!\nThe FAIR framework aims to encourage data reuse by both humans and computers by improving the findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability of data and other resources. So what are the steps involved in FAIR-ifying data?\n\n\nF is for Findable\nBefore data can be reused, we need to make sure it can be found. One way to do this is by tagging it with metadata (information about the data), such as what type of data it is, who collected it, the conditions used, and so on. This allows it to be indexed in a searchable registry so more people will see it. Metadata is important for both helping people find your data and for understanding the context they were generated in.\nAnother key way to make sure data is findable is by assigning it a persistent identifier. This is a long-lasting digital reference which ensures a resource can always be found, no matter where it's stored. DOIs (digital object identifiers) are one type of persistent identifier that you have probably heard of before - they can be applied to things like journal articles, data sets and other publications.\n\n\nA is for Accessible\nOnce we've made sure people can find our data, we need to make sure they can access it if they have permission. This means making it retrievable using some kind of standardised protocol, without any need for specialised or proprietary tools. We also need to tell people how they can get access, so we should include this as one of our metadata fields.\nA common misconception is that all FAIR data is 'open' or 'free'. Heavily protected or private data can still be FAIR as long as it is clear under which conditions the data is accessible.\n\n\nI is for Interoperable\nSo now we've made it possible for someone to find and access our data. How can we make sure they can actually use it? There are two aspects to interoperability. The first is using standardised and open formats so that data can be exchanged and used across multiple different applications and systems. This means avoiding proprietary formats and conforming with field-specific standards about what format data should come in.\nThe second relates to how computers understand our data in comparison with other data. This is possible using a 'controlled vocabulary' or 'ontology' which ensures that everyone is using the same words for the same thing. Again, we should try and conform with field-specific standards around ontologies.\n\n\nR is for Reusable\nThis final principle emphasises the idea that by following the previous three principles- findable, accessible, interoperable- we should be aiming to make our data as reusable as possible. This means using accurate and richly described metadata that gives a full overview of our experimental process and data analysis workflow.\nWe should also make it clear what rights the discoverer has when reusing our data. This is achieved by applying a licence, and clearly specifying this in the metadata. For example, a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International licence (or CC-BY for short) lets anyone reuse, remix and adapt material as long as credit is given to the original creator. \n\n\nSummary\nThe FAIR framework guides us through ensuring that our data is easy to find, easy to understand and easy to reuse. This ensures that our data is used to the fullest extent possible.\nThe FAIR principles apply to digital objects beyond just data. At Cloud-SPAN we are working hard to make sure our learning resources are as FAIR as possible. Find out what we're doing to achieve this by visiting our handbook, or look out for our next blog post!\nFurther reading:\n\nThe 10 FAIR Principles\nPaper in Nature: The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship"

    "title": "Course Update",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Well, it’s been a couple of weeks since we ran our first course and we’ve certainly learned a lot from it! Most of the problems we stumbled into were minor teething issues, but we’re also going to be making some fairly major changes based on what we learned. Here’s a bit of an update:\n\nFirst thing’s first... positive feedback!\nWe had some amazing feedback from our first run-through! We asked our participants to rate their level of comfort with a number of topics before and after completing the course.\nAs you can see in the graph below, on average our participants felt that their level of comfort had improved after taking the course for all topics. This is great news!\nIn particular, participants ended the course feeling really comfortable with using the command line to navigate file directories, create and modify files and search for keywords.\n\n\n\nThe BIG Problem: Time flies\nThe biggest problem we ran into was time. We just didn’t have enough of it...\n...and that means we need to seriously rethink how we structure the content of our course. You can see from the graph above that the topics people felt they had improved their confidence the least in were those relating to genomics - assessing read quality, trimming and filtering, and variant calling.\nThat’s because before we could teach those topics, we had to make sure people felt really comfortable using the command line and organising their files. Unfortunately, as we got more and more behind schedule, this meant the genomics topics got less and less time allocated to them.\nThis is a problem, because the title of the course was Foundational Genomics. If participants are finishing our course feeling like they are not comfortable with variant calling (which is what a score of 3 means) then we need to make some changes. Plus, the genomics bit is meant to be the fun bit!\nThe written feedback we had from participants after the course, while mostly positive, generally reflected this sentiment too.\n\n\nThe BIG Solution: Course structure\nIn light of this feedback, we’ve decided to split our 4 x half-day Foundational Genomics course into two shorter courses: one 2 x half-day “Prenomics” course and one 4 x half-day “Genomics” course.\nThe Prenomics course will be aimed at complete beginners and will be a gentle introduction to file directories, working paths and basic command line commands. By giving ourselves two half-days to cover this content we should be able to ensure all participants are fully on board before we move onto anything more complex.\nThis course will also be optional for those who already have some basic experience using the command line. We plan to screen potential attendees using a self-test to help them determine whether they would benefit from attending the Prenomics course, or skipping straight to Genomics.\nThe Genomics course will follow directly on from Prenomics, using many of the same commands and building on them further. We should have much more time to cover essential topics such as read quality and variant calling which were rushed last time, allowing us to offer a much better educational experience.\n\n\nSome smaller problems which this change also solves...\n\nWe plan to run the Genomics course over two weeks, with 2 x half days per week. This, combined with a hopefully much less stressful volume of content to cover, will decrease pressure on our instructors and helpers, most of whom have multiple other work and teaching commitments.\nSome of our participants felt the course went far too slowly; others felt it went too fast. By screening for those who have the least experience working in the command line, we should be able to both provide more support to those who need it and stop more experienced participants from getting bored.\n\n\n\nOther updates in the pipeline\nThese two new courses, Prenomics and Genomics, will make up the ‘Foundational’ element of our content. We still have plans to developed ‘Advanced’ modules on topics such as automation and setting up cloud instances. We asked our participants to let us know what they’d like to see, and we’ll be taking these suggestions into account as we go.\nWe also have plans to run some (hopefully) in-person ‘hack days’ for alumni of our Foundational courses, where we can help participants apply the skills learned in the course to their own problems, and assist in troubleshooting any problems. We hope this will help develop our community of practice further by providing opportunities for networking and building relationships.\nAnd that’s it. Thanks for reading this far - we hope it explains some of our rationale for why the course is structured the way it is. We’re really proud of our achievements with our first ever course, and we’re looking forward to trying some new stuff out next time.\nTill next time! 👋"
