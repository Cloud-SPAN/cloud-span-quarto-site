    "section": "How Prenomics was born",
    "text": "How Prenomics was born\nWhen we ran our first Genomics course in autumn 2021, we discovered that a major sticking point for many participants was directory structure and navigation. This was making it really difficult to help people log into the cloud, where we could then teach them core command line skills. We spent much more time troubleshooting and going over these basic skills than we‚Äôd expected, meaning we had to rush through more complex content later on about analysis tools and pipelines.¬†\nOverall, this meant our learners began their command line journey from a place of frustration (which has a huge impact on confidence) and we were forced to minimise the amount of time spent on the ‚Äògenomics‚Äô part of the Genomics course.\nAs a result, we split the original Genomics curriculum across two courses: Prenomics and Genomics. In Prenomics, all the focus is on the command line. We teach about files and directory structure, and spend lots of time guiding learners through creating a folder and navigating to it without using the command line. We also teach those crucial core skills - commonly used commands like ls, cd and mv. Later, as learners gain confidence, we move on to more complex commands like grep and redirection with &gt; and &gt;&gt;."

    "section": "Why is Prenomics important?",
    "text": "Why is Prenomics important?\nSeparating the curriculum into two courses has several benefits. Most importantly, it gives us lots more time to dedicate to core skills and troubleshooting. It also gives us more time to spend on Genomics, as learners start that course already confident about their command line abilities. Plus, those already familiar with the command line can skip Prenomics and go straight to Genomics.\nAnd it works! We know this because we collect evaluation feedback from participants both before and after the course, asking them to evaluate their understanding of various topics. After we ran the newly designed Prenomics/Genomics combo course in Spring 2022, we compared the understanding scores of learners across three general themes of Command Line, Genomics and Project Organisation (a higher number means a higher level of understanding, with no understanding being 1 and most confident understanding being 6).\n\n\n\n."

    "title": "Challenges in Environmental ‚ÄôOmics",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Hardware\nThe size and nature of ‚Äòomics data means it is often necessary to employ high performance computing (HPC) resources for analysis. This presents an inherent challenge as use of such resources requires a specific skill set that not all researchers will have (see ‚Äòskills‚Äô below for more details).\nA secondary challenge relating to hardware is the rapidly changing HPC landscape. Between institutions HPC architectures can vary wildly. Although the basic skills needed to access them remain the same, the setup and execution of jobs may look quite different. Even within institutions, HPC setups mature and are replaced regularly as new technologies develop and the demand for resources grows. For example, the Biology department at the University of York has had access to three different setups (c2d2, YARCC and Viking) in the last nine years, with a new iteration (Viking2) currently in the works. This frequent turnover requires users to continually adjust and adapt their workflows to the new system.\n\n\nSoftware\nThere are several issues surrounding the software involved in analysis of environmental omics datasets. Firstly, software tends to have a steep learning curve, requiring a substantial time investment for researchers. This investment will not necessarily always pay off, if the end result is not what is required.¬†\nSecondly, even if a piece of software does do what is needed, it is not guaranteed that it will be usable on the HPC architecture available. Installation of software is not always straightforward, if it is allowed in the first place. The rapid turnover and replacement of HPC architectures only serves to compound this problem, and the heterogeneity of HPC setups between institutions makes it difficult to find bespoke instructions for software installation.\nThe final, broader issue is around access to learning resources and tutorials. Some popular, non-field-specific tools such as R or Python have countless online tutorials and instructions dedicated to their use, aimed at all different levels of understanding. Others, especially more niche software programs, have very few resources. Those that do exist may be out of date, or assume a level of knowledge beyond that of most novices (for example, many documentation pages are entirely inaccessible to a newcomer). As new software emerges and supersedes previously popular programs, the lack of help available only worsens.\n\n\nSkills\nAs previously mentioned, environmental omics analysis has a steep learning curve. A major challenge for many new researchers is grappling with previously unencountered skills such as using the UNIX command line, navigating file systems, writing shell scripts, grappling with dependencies and specifying resources for HPC. This is all before any specific pieces of software are involved, each of which will require its own set of skills and understanding.\nThese skills are required on top of the experimental design and data collection skills needed to generate datasets in the first place. Often those collecting data are the ones best placed to know how to interrogate it, as all experiments are different and bespoke analysis is crucial. This requires researchers to learn and juggle a large collection of skills, not all of which are immediately relevant to their chosen area of study.\n\n\nTime\nFinally, there are time investments involved in all of the above challenges. There is the ‚Äòbrain time‚Äô involved in learning new skills, problem-solving and working with new software. Then, once an analysis is ready to run, it will take time to run. HPC resources are usually shared across many users, with jobs being added to a queue to run when resources are available - analyses requiring large amounts of compute may be queued for days or weeks waiting for the required resources to come available. In addition, some analyses take a long time to run given the size of the datasets involved and the complexity of the analysis.\nOnce analysis is completed time must be invested in interpreting and visualising the results. If parameters need to be adjusted following this, then the whole process must begin again. This makes optimisation of analysis difficult and time-consuming to the point that it may not even happen at all.\nAt Cloud-SPAN our goal is to help you overcome these challenges. Read more about the courses we offer or take a look at our introductory ‚ÄôPrenomics‚Äô course materials or specialised Genomics course to see how our training can equip you better!\n\n\n\n."

The event took place at the University of York, with several participants travelling from other institutions for the day.\nSome people took the opportunity to revisit course materials and ask questions about the topics they didn‚Äôt understand. There were plenty of helpers on hand to answer questions and test understanding.\nOthers chose to apply the workflows and analyses taught in the Genomics course to their own datasets. Again, helpers were on hand to discuss topics such as:\n\nhow to organise bioinformatics projects;\nwhich tools are most effective;\nhow to approach a problem;\nwhat analysis is best for a certain type of data;\n\nas well as many others.¬†\nSome participants knew what help they needed and had specific questions to address during the day. Those with a less clear understanding of their problem benefited from talking through their data and getting guidance from our experienced instructors. Some even tried out new software tools not discussed during the course.\nFinally, some participants decided to trial our new self-study course on creating your own Amazon Web Services cloud instance. They were able to ask questions about the content and provided valuable feedback on which parts of the course needed improvement.\nEveryone enjoyed the chance to meet new people and find out about each others‚Äô research. It was a great chance to network and build some community amongst course alumni.\nOur next code retreat for Cloud-SPAN course alumni will be on July 6th at the University of York. We cover travel expenses and lunch is provided. We‚Äôre looking forward to meeting more of our community members and providing valuable one-to-one support!\nContact us at cloud-span-project@york.ac.uk to sign up.\n\n\n\nImage: Instructors and course alumni at April‚Äôs code retreat."

    "title": "Making the Prenomics summary poster",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I recently designed a poster that acts as a ‚Äúcheat sheet‚Äù for Cloud-SPAN‚Äôs Prenomics course. Here I‚Äôll give a quick overview of my thought process while making the poster and how I chose what to include.\n\nCommand cheatsheet\nI started with the command cheatsheet, which is a bit back-to-front given that the command line comes chronologically last in the course. However, it seemed like an easy entry point. I had previously produced a glossary for Prenomics, so I took this and organised the commands into logical groupings based on their function.¬†\nI ended up with four groups: navigating files, viewing files, editing files and searching files. There were two commands which didn‚Äôt fit into these groups, which were history and man. I tried to find a way to include them, but ultimately left them out as I decided they were not crucial knowledge.\nI tried to format the commands in a way that made it clear how to use them while still keeping it general and easily readable. I used colour to clarify which parts of the command corresponded to which parts of the explanation. For example:\n\n\n\n.\n\n\nIn this case ‚Äòfile‚Äô (the file to be moved) is pale blue while ‚Äòdirectory‚Äô (the location to which the file should be moved) is dark blue. I also used underlining to indicate where the command came from - in this case, mv comes from the m and the v of ‚Äòmove‚Äô. My aim here was to aid recall of the command in future, as hopefully it will help the reader make a stronger mental connection between the command mv and its function (‚Äòmove a file‚Äô).\n\n\nFiles, paths and file types\nThe command line makes up a significant portion of the Prenomics course, but it could be summarised in a relatively small amount of space. To work out what else should be included, I looked at the course more holistically. The first lesson of the course is about files and directories, so it was clear to me that there needed to be a section about this. This lesson also covers the file types used in the course, including .FASTQ and .PEM files which are likely to be new to most learners, so I wanted to include this too.\nI found it difficult to summarise the information about file paths and directories into a mostly graphical format. In particular, I found that I couldn‚Äôt rely on giving examples as much as we do in the course itself, due to the need to reduce text as much as possible. I ended up just including definitions of absolute and relative paths, along with a diagram of the file system inside the Cloud-SPAN AWS instance.\nIf I‚Äôd had space, I would have included more information on working directories and examples of how the file system diagram can be represented with file paths.\n\n\nWhy use‚Ä¶?\nThe next sections I designed were the ‚ÄòWhy learn command line?‚Äô and ‚ÄòWhy use the cloud?‚Äô sections.\nThe question of why the command line is useful is covered in episode three of the first day of Prenomics, as part of the introduction to the shell. I distilled the reasons given here down into four main themes: automation of repetitive tasks, reducing human error (as a result of automation), improving reproducibility and the ability to access new tools (either because the command line offers more functionality or because it opens up use of high performance computing systems (HPC) such as the cloud).\n\n\n\n.\n\n\nThe other question- why cloud computing is useful- is not technically covered in Prenomics material. However, it is discussed in our Genomics course, where the three reasons given for using HPC are lack of resources needed to run analyses, analyses taking a long time to run and problems installing software. These reasons align closely with three of the challenges identified by Cloud-SPAN project lead, James Chong, as facing the field of metagenomics (hardware, time and software).\nHowever, these reasons could actually be used as a reason to use any kind of HPC resource, not just the cloud. I wanted to include reasons specific to the cloud. The two major reasons I came across were the ability to share software or data containers across different institutions, and use of the cloud when other HPC is inaccessible.¬†\nIn an earlier version of the poster, the ‚Äòwhy use cloud?‚Äô section was framed in terms of challenges that users might face, such as long analysis times or issues installing software. I reworded this section to match the framing of the ‚Äòwhy learn command line?‚Äô section; that is, a solutions-oriented summary, with ‚Äòshorten analysis times‚Äô replacing ‚Äòlong analysis times‚Äô and ‚Äòuse pre-installed software‚Äô‚Äô replacing ‚Äòissues installing software‚Äô.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\nFile types\nLastly I wanted to include a brief summary of the file types used in the Prenomics course, as it is likely that two out of three of these will be new to learners. This part was quite easy - I just wrote a short sentence to describe each file type and paired it with the relevant file extension.\nIn the course a significant amount of time is dedicated to introducing the .fastq file structure, which codes sequencing data into a text format with four lines per read. I considered including this information but I didn‚Äôt have room.\n\n\nThe big reveal‚Ä¶\nAnd finally, here‚Äôs the full poster! You can download a high-res version of the poster for your own enjoyment here.\n\n\n\n."

    "text": "Cloud HPC\nWe use commercially-available cloud computing resources to address the challenges of hardware, software and time.\nHere‚Äôs how it works: we teach our courses inside a containerised instance, which is a virtual environment containing pre-loaded software and files. The instance runs on hardware borrowed from a commercial provider (in our case, Amazon Web Services). All our learners have to do is log into the cloud instance we provide, and they will have access to all of the software and data used in the course. The instances all start out identical, so the file structure always looks the same, and they run on enough borrowed resources to make analysis relatively quick and easy.\nUsing this kind of pre-loaded instance benefits our learners by removing complications around different HPC setups and the installation of software onto a cluster. It also makes it easier for us to teach - we know that everyone is starting with the same setup, so we can offer our courses to anyone regardless of institution. It allows us to model best practices for directory structure and project organisation, and save time when troubleshooting issues.\nAnother major advantage of running analyses on cloud resources is that we don‚Äôt have to wait in a queue for resources to be available, as we‚Äôve already loaned out the resources we need. This can save a lot of time for large analyses, and is especially useful for teaching.\nAfter completing one of our courses, learners can go away and apply their new skills to their own data by setting up their own cloud instance, which is identical to the one used in the course. It contains all the same software and basic file structures, so provides a familiar environment for further learning and analysis. Using these kinds of services outside of the course does incur a cost, but we also support learners in applying for research credits."

    "title": "What is FAIR data?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "At Cloud-SPAN we care deeply about making science as open as possible. A lot of this comes down to project management and data organisation - which we teach as part of our Genomics course. Today we want to introduce you to the FAIR data principles, which are a framework for thinking about how to ensure the scientific community gets the most out of the data we produce. In this case, this means making it easier for people to find and reuse our hard-earned data!\nThe FAIR framework aims to encourage data reuse by both humans and computers by improving the findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability of data and other resources. So what are the steps involved in FAIR-ifying data?\n\n\nF is for Findable\nBefore data can be reused, we need to make sure it can be found. One way to do this is by tagging it with metadata (information about the data), such as what type of data it is, who collected it, the conditions used, and so on. This allows it to be indexed in a searchable registry so more people will see it. Metadata is important for both helping people find your data and for understanding the context they were generated in.\nAnother key way to make sure data is findable is by assigning it a persistent identifier. This is a long-lasting digital reference which ensures a resource can always be found, no matter where it's stored. DOIs (digital object identifiers) are one type of persistent identifier that you have probably heard of before - they can be applied to things like journal articles, data sets and other publications.\n\n\nA is for Accessible\nOnce we've made sure people can find our data, we need to make sure they can access it if they have permission. This means making it retrievable using some kind of standardised protocol, without any need for specialised or proprietary tools. We also need to tell people how they can get access, so we should include this as one of our metadata fields.\nA common misconception is that all FAIR data is 'open' or 'free'. Heavily protected or private data can still be FAIR as long as it is clear under which conditions the data is accessible.\n\n\nI is for Interoperable\nSo now we've made it possible for someone to find and access our data. How can we make sure they can actually use it? There are two aspects to interoperability. The first is using standardised and open formats so that data can be exchanged and used across multiple different applications and systems. This means avoiding proprietary formats and conforming with field-specific standards about what format data should come in.\nThe second relates to how computers understand our data in comparison with other data. This is possible using a 'controlled vocabulary' or 'ontology' which ensures that everyone is using the same words for the same thing. Again, we should try and conform with field-specific standards around ontologies.\n\n\nR is for Reusable\nThis final principle emphasises the idea that by following the previous three principles- findable, accessible, interoperable- we should be aiming to make our data as reusable as possible. This means using accurate and richly described metadata that gives a full overview of our experimental process and data analysis workflow.\nWe should also make it clear what rights the discoverer has when reusing our data. This is achieved by applying a licence, and clearly specifying this in the metadata. For example, a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International licence (or CC-BY for short) lets anyone reuse, remix and adapt material as long as credit is given to the original creator.¬†\n\n\nSummary\nThe FAIR framework guides us through ensuring that our data is easy to find, easy to understand and easy to reuse. This ensures that our data is used to the fullest extent possible.\nThe FAIR principles apply to digital objects beyond just data. At Cloud-SPAN we are working hard to make sure our learning resources are as FAIR as possible. Find out what we're doing to achieve this by visiting our handbook, or look out for our next blog post!\nFurther reading:\n\nThe 10 FAIR Principles\nPaper in Nature: The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Previously we shared some information about FAIR data, and explained why it‚Äôs important to make sure your data is as reusable as possible.¬†\nThe FAIR principles aren‚Äôt just for data. Our aim is to apply the principles to all our training resources to ensure that they can be reused and remixed by others for their own teaching purposes. Here‚Äôs a look at how we‚Äôre doing it:\n\nFindable\nRemember, findability is about making it easy to find your data or resource. We‚Äôve added metadata to our resources, which enables us to register our courses with TeSS, a life sciences training repository. The metadata means people can search and filter to find our course based on what they need. You can see the metadata for our Prenomics course at the top of the source page here.\nIn addition, we have also registered our training resources on Zenodo, another repository which assigns a DOI to each stored item. This persistent identifier will give our resources a permanent home, even after other links become deprecated.\n\n\nAccessible\nTo be accessible it needs to be easy to retrieve a resource without any special tools. It should also be clear how to do this. We‚Äôve made this really easy for ourselves by hosting our courses online for free on a dedicated set of webpages via GitHub Pages.\n\n\nInteroperable\nInteroperability means ensuring that computers can understand and open a resource. We do this by providing data for analysis in de facto file standards such as FASTQ and using Markdown (a widely-used and platform-independent text formatting language for writing resources) for course material.\nWe also help computers to understand how our resources fit into a bigger picture by using an ‚Äòontology‚Äô to describe the topics of our courses. This forms part of the metadata and helps people to filter and understand what our resources are about. For example, we use the EDAM ontology of bioscientific data analysis and data management. We‚Äôve labelled our Prenomics course as falling under topics 3372 (software engineering) and 0622 (genomics).\n\n\nReusable\nAll of the things just described help promote reusability. In particular, we promote reusability by tagging our resources with rich metadata - we use the Bioschemas Training Material protocol which suggests a list of metadata properties for biosciences training materials.\nWe also help people reuse our materials by applying a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) licence, which means anyone can distribute, remix, adapt or build on our work as long as they credit us. We include details of this licence in our metadata, in our GitHub repositories and at the bottom of our course pages so it‚Äôs clear to everyone what the rules are.\n\n\nOver to you!\nWhat steps are you taking to make your data and other digital resources as FAIR as possible? There are some great resources available online to help you if you‚Äôre not sure where to start - try howtofair.dk or the FAIR Cookbook for helpful articles, videos and step-by-step guides!\n\n\n\n."

Helpers are also on hand to discuss topics such as:\n\nhow to organise bioinformatics projects;\nwhich tools are most effective;\nhow to approach a problem;\nwhat analysis is best for a certain type of data;\n\nas well as many others.¬†\nSome participants already know what help they will need and have specific questions to address during the day. Those with a less clear understanding of their problem could benefit from talking through their data and getting guidance from our experienced instructors. You could even try out new software tools.\nWhat do previous participants have to say?\n‚ÄúI had a great time at the Cloud-Span retreat. I went from Lancaster just for it, and it was worth it. I got support in analysing the data I had in hand. That was really satisfying applying what we preciously learned (using our data this time). Having the Cloud-Span Team around to support us was essential. It‚Äôs been great learning with them, and I would 100% recommend them!‚Äù\n\n\n\n.\n\n\nJoin us for our next event!\nOur next Code Retreat for Cloud-SPAN Alumni will take place 10:30-15:00 on 31st May 2023 at the University of York. Feel free to stay for the whole event or drop in when you are free. Lunch will be provided and we offer support to cover travel expenses.\nRegistration deadline - 12pm Wednesday 24th May.\nSign up using the registration form.\nTraining courses\nIf you are interested in attending our free training courses&gt;&gt; please visit our website for further information."

    "title": "Course Update",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Well, it‚Äôs been a couple of weeks since we ran our first course and we‚Äôve certainly learned a lot from it! Most of the problems we stumbled into were minor teething issues, but we‚Äôre also going to be making some fairly major changes based on what we learned. Here‚Äôs a bit of an update:\n\nFirst thing‚Äôs first... positive feedback!\nWe had some amazing feedback from our first run-through! We asked our participants to rate their level of comfort with a number of topics before and after completing the course.\nAs you can see in the graph below, on average our participants felt that their level of comfort had improved after taking the course for all topics. This is great news!\nIn particular, participants ended the course feeling really comfortable with using the command line to navigate file directories, create and modify files and search for keywords.\n\n\n\nThe BIG Problem: Time flies\nThe biggest problem we ran into was time. We just didn‚Äôt have enough of it...\n...and that means we need to seriously rethink how we structure the content of our course. You can see from the graph above that the topics people felt they had improved their confidence the least in were those relating to genomics - assessing read quality, trimming and filtering, and variant calling.\nThat‚Äôs because before we could teach those topics, we had to make sure people felt really comfortable using the command line and organising their files. Unfortunately, as we got more and more behind schedule, this meant the genomics topics got less and less time allocated to them.\nThis is a problem, because the title of the course was Foundational Genomics. If participants are finishing our course feeling like they are not comfortable with variant calling (which is what a score of 3 means) then we need to make some changes. Plus, the genomics bit is meant to be the fun bit!\nThe written feedback we had from participants after the course, while mostly positive, generally reflected this sentiment too.\n\n\nThe BIG Solution: Course structure\nIn light of this feedback, we‚Äôve decided to split our 4 x half-day Foundational Genomics course into two shorter courses: one 2 x half-day ‚ÄúPrenomics‚Äù course and one 4 x half-day ‚ÄúGenomics‚Äù course.\nThe Prenomics course will be aimed at complete beginners and will be a gentle introduction to file directories, working paths and basic command line commands. By giving ourselves two half-days to cover this content we should be able to ensure all participants are fully on board before we move onto anything more complex.\nThis course will also be optional for those who already have some basic experience using the command line. We plan to screen potential attendees using a self-test to help them determine whether they would benefit from attending the Prenomics course, or skipping straight to Genomics.\nThe Genomics course will follow directly on from Prenomics, using many of the same commands and building on them further. We should have much more time to cover essential topics such as read quality and variant calling which were rushed last time, allowing us to offer a much better educational experience.\n\n\nSome smaller problems which this change also solves...\n\nWe plan to run the Genomics course over two weeks, with 2 x half days per week. This, combined with a hopefully much less stressful volume of content to cover, will decrease pressure on our instructors and helpers, most of whom have multiple other work and teaching commitments.\nSome of our participants felt the course went far too slowly; others felt it went too fast. By screening for those who have the least experience working in the command line, we should be able to both provide more support to those who need it and stop more experienced participants from getting bored.\n\n\n\nOther updates in the pipeline\nThese two new courses, Prenomics and Genomics, will make up the ‚ÄòFoundational‚Äô element of our content. We still have plans to developed ‚ÄòAdvanced‚Äô modules on topics such as automation and setting up cloud instances. We asked our participants to let us know what they‚Äôd like to see, and we‚Äôll be taking these suggestions into account as we go.\nWe also have plans to run some (hopefully) in-person ‚Äòhack days‚Äô for alumni of our Foundational courses, where we can help participants apply the skills learned in the course to their own problems, and assist in troubleshooting any problems. We hope this will help develop our community of practice further by providing opportunities for networking and building relationships.\nAnd that‚Äôs it. Thanks for reading this far - we hope it explains some of our rationale for why the course is structured the way it is. We‚Äôre really proud of our achievements with our first ever course, and we‚Äôre looking forward to trying some new stuff out next time.\nTill next time! üëã"

    "section": "How Prenomics was born",
    "text": "How Prenomics was born\nWhen we ran our first Genomics course in autumn 2021, we discovered that a major sticking point for many participants was directory structure and navigation. This was making it really difficult to help people log into the cloud, where we could then teach them core command line skills. We spent much more time troubleshooting and going over these basic skills than we‚Äôd expected, meaning we had to rush through more complex content later on about analysis tools and pipelines.¬†\nOverall, this meant our learners began their command line journey from a place of frustration (which has a huge impact on confidence) and we were forced to minimise the amount of time spent on the ‚Äògenomics‚Äô part of the Genomics course.\nAs a result, we split the original Genomics curriculum across two courses: Prenomics and Genomics. In Prenomics, all the focus is on the command line. We teach about files and directory structure, and spend lots of time guiding learners through creating a folder and navigating to it without using the command line. We also teach those crucial core skills - commonly used commands like ls, cd and mv. Later, as learners gain confidence, we move on to more complex commands like grep and redirection with &gt; and &gt;&gt;."

    "section": "Why is Prenomics important?",
    "text": "Why is Prenomics important?\nSeparating the curriculum into two courses has several benefits. Most importantly, it gives us lots more time to dedicate to core skills and troubleshooting. It also gives us more time to spend on Genomics, as learners start that course already confident about their command line abilities. Plus, those already familiar with the command line can skip Prenomics and go straight to Genomics.\nAnd it works! We know this because we collect evaluation feedback from participants both before and after the course, asking them to evaluate their understanding of various topics. After we ran the newly designed Prenomics/Genomics combo course in Spring 2022, we compared the understanding scores of learners across three general themes of Command Line, Genomics and Project Organisation (a higher number means a higher level of understanding, with no understanding being 1 and most confident understanding being 6).\n\n\n\n."
